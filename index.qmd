# Introduction

## What it is? (in plain English)

DAIOE tracks how advances in artificial intelligence change the potential impact of AI on different occupations over time. It’s a panel index (2010–) that updates annually and distinguishes between nine major AI subdomains (e.g., language modeling, image generation, speech recognition). Think of it as a moving barometer of where AI capabilities could matter most—not as a forecast of job loss or gain. The net employment effect, e.g., depends on how organisations adopt and apply AI.

## Why it’s useful?

Because DAIOE is dynamic and subdomain-specific, it’s better aligned with real technical progress than static, one-shot measures. In essence, it "unpacks" AI--enabling analysis of how exposed occupations are to different types of AI. By combining DAIOE with other data that have occupation codes, such as industry-level data or linked employer-employee data, researchers and policymakers can trace exposure by occupation, sector, skill level, or country (e.g., Denmark, Portugal, Sweden in our firm-level applications), and test whether AI exposure is associated with up-skilling or reallocation inside firms and industries. In our firm-level evidence, total employment associations are small on average, but exposure is linked to a higher share of high-skilled white-collar work and a lower share of low-skill clerical roles. Meanwhile, results differ meaningfully across different types of AI, underlining the importance of "unpacking" exposure to AI.
